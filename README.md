# Type-Speed-Game
A typing game 
How it works : 
The words float down your screen. The user must type the words in order to earn points and make the word disappear.
The bigger the word, the higher the difficulty, the greater the points obtained. 
The words must be cleared before they reach the bottom of the screen.

needed: -> a clean difficulty system   
        -> prettier UI  
	-> a game over screen         

future updates: -> adding jpeg images to the UI 
                -> adding a pause button 
		-> adding a difficulty selector
